# Word Shark
A version of hangman where a stickman slowly falls into shark infested waters. 
The hangman exercise in Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp was used as a starting point. 
The hangman game, which used class components, was converted to functional components using hooks and then restyled into Word Shark.

Word Shark concept by 'Melissha' (waygook.org).
